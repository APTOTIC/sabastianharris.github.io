                <p class="mbr-text align-center mbr-fonts-style my-4 display-7"><strong>The Legal Story Of Sabastian Harris
<br></strong>
<br>In 2014 I married a woman named lucero, her mother was very racist against me, she wouldn’t tolerate a white son-in-law in the family. The reality of it is, she was racist against all races that wasn't not mexican. My wife was very unhealthy with several medical conditions, and in 2014 I personally witnessed a physical altercation between my wife and her mother where they were having a loud argument with each other and her mother reached over and grab my wife by her hair and threw her to the ground. I intervened but I was too far away to be of any Immedient use. The incident made me worry about my wife's safety, she didn’t own a phone, and her mother kept her sheltered and refused to buy her one, Her health conditions prevented her from working, so she had no ability to provide for herself, and my wife mother was her payee, so any money that went to my wife, stayed in her mothers pocket, on top of making money for taking care of her own daughter through IHSS, So I bought her a phone, I wasn’t making much, so I bought a cheap phone from seven eleven and got the only plan I could afford, then during a phone call I heard another altercation, and I heard a loud bang, I was very worried and stayed on the phone, I got my keys and started walking to my car to drive down, and before I took off my wife picked up the phone and told me not to come, and she told me her mother smashed her phone, I saw the phone the next day, not much damage was done, but the back battery compartment wouldn’t stay on, so I bought her another phone with a case and asked her to find another living situation. We ended up getting married, and she moved in with me and my parents, she ended up being homesick, regardless of how her mother treated her, she missed her mom, so she ended up moving back, we were married, but not under the same roof, we would call each other often and I heard yet again another altercation.
<br>
<br>In 2015 – Due to all the altercations, I ended up having a plan that I thought would solve all the problems. I was young and stupid and although sometimes taking the risky gamble leads to good things, they don’t call it risky for no reason, I told my wife to tell her mother that we were no longer together, we would have to meet in secret, I was planning to file a restraining order, I told her to make sure when she was served, her mother was there to see it, - the plan was that her mother would see it, and think we were no longer together, and stop hurting my wife, it was only suppose to last until we could come up with a less temporary plan. The judge would see the case, and no one would show up, and the order would we withheld and remain withheld, but anyone with a more experienced brain then mine, would have realized my wifes mothers possible retaliation. she retaliated all right, She put out her own restraining order by threatening my wifes life and health through abandonment, and as planned I did not show up which resulted in my restraining order being withheld and my mother-in-laws under my wifes name, to be placed.
<br>
<br>Within the same year, I was arrested for misdemeanor restraining order violation several times without ever being charged with a violent crime, in fact I was arrested so many times, that I was placed on felony probation without ever actually committing a felony. After that, every time I was arrested for a misdemeanor restraining order violation, there would always be a felony charge added (Felony Probation Violation), and on top of that, I had to attend a Battery Intervention Program, or BIP, then, I would be forced to pay a grand total of 5,000 for BIP, My wife and I were homeless begging for food at the time, because my life was bringing the legal problems to my parents doorstep, and no one hires the homeless in California, so an income to pay the 5,000 wasn’t happening, my wife even yelled at the judge at one of my hearings as I was sitting with the other inmates, saying the restraining order was a lie, and it was forced on her by her mother, and she said she wanted it removed But, the judge refused because, In her own words, she didn’t want to step on any other judges toes.
<br>
<br>In 2016 - I ended up truly homeless because of all the legal trouble. My wife and I had a shared opinion, no one person, or any form of the government, or the justice system, has a right to say weather me and my wife can be together, only we have the right to make that discission, and my wife didn’t want me to give up, We made the neutral discission to disobey, that opened my life to being the type of felon that the justice system loves to go after. Every time I was released I refused to report to probation or report to BIP, I was homeless, and I had to beg for small change just to eat at my local fast food restaurant, so I refused to pay any money, and I kept getting arrested for misdemeanor restraining order violation, and felony probation violation. Each time I got arrested I would spend longer in jail then the last, then a judge threatened me with 5 years in prison if I violated again. 
<br>
<br>In 2017 – After I was released, I still didn’t listen, we ran to los angeles, about 6 hours south from where I lived, I was still homeless, and still begging for money. While we were in Los Angeles, we finally had our first real Halloween and thanksgiving since we got married, but then in December, my wife and I slept on the sidewalk outside a church on Gower street in Hollywood until morning, where they served hot breakfast to the homeless, when she woke up she was spitting up blood, and she couldn’t breathe, I dialed 911, and the ambulance came, and they took her to saint josephs hospital in Burbank where she was diagnose with pneumonia, and she died 3 days later. She followed me to the street, to make sure I was safe, because she felt like she had to take care of me, and for the first time, I was truly alone. I hadn't talked to my parents in a year, I was able to remember there number after a while, and I called to let them know, I also called her mother to let her know, all her mother did was insult her and me.
<br>
<br>Conclusion
<br>I am not the victim in this situation, if the police and the justice system weren't made to think, they have more authority then they truly, lawfully do, and if they never tried to force there unlawful authority on us, then my wife would still be alive today. No matter what, the justice system should have been there, to protect my wife.
<br>
<br>My Message To You
<br>My wife is not the only victim, cases like these are not rare, and thats a big problem in this country, we need to fix it. There are true criminals in this country and unfortunately many have taken refuge within our government, resulting in the government protecting them. Police must change there allegiance from the government to the people. Or risk an organization, of equal powers to theirs, to be created to enforce laws on, not on the citizens, but public servants only. My goal is to add to the justice system, a prevention system, police officers are to catch criminals on the street, as well as in the government, but who do you call, when you blow 3 zeros in a breathalyzer, and still being accused of DUI, or when an officer unlawfully breaks down your door without a warrant, or any exigent circumstance, or when you're walking down the street minding your own business and an officer of the law stops you, and demands identification and you know, you have no legal responsibility to do so? Who do you call? I am the answer to that very question, 199 will be the number to call. With your support, we will have true law and order. Everyone who breaks the law, will be subject to the same punishment, regardless of worth, status or degree.&nbsp;<br></p>
